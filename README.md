Mini Challenge 8 - Reverse It Endpoint

Web API project that will have 2 different endpoints. One for reversing a string and one for reversing an int. Both have data validation so an error message will pop up when you enter the incorrect variable type. There is also an instructions page at the /minich8 URL. So it makes it a little easier for people to go to the two different end points. URLs also provided in the error messages for easy routing.

# Directions:
1. Open the file in visual studio code.
2. Run the debug either by clicking on the "run and debug" icon on the left side and then the green play button, or by using the F5 command.
3. Next you want to go to your debug console located on the bottom by your terminal.
4. Then look for the "Now listening on:" and there should be a local host URL that you can copy.
5. Take that URL and you can either paste it into a web browser, or by using an application called Postman, you can hit the plus sign at the top of Postman and paste the URL there.
6. After you paste the localhost URL either into a browser or postman, add /MiniCh8 at the end and press send. For example: https://localhost:7221/MiniCh8 and this will lead you to an instructions page to help guide you through the application! *See end of directions for what the Instructions page will look like.*
7. After you paste the localhost URL either into a web browser or Postman, add /MiniCh8/ReverseNum to the end for numbers or /MiniCh8/ReverseWords for strings. It should look something like this: https://localhost:7221/MiniCh8
8. At this point you're almost done! Just add a /yourNameGoesHere (but with your preferred name of course) at the end of the URL and press send! For example my URL would look like this: https://localhost:7221/MiniCh8/ReverseNum/12345 or https://localhost:7221/MiniCh8/ReverseWord/Brandon
9. If you're having trouble don't forget to check your local host to make sure you're using the right number and ensure that you ran the debug before attempting to use the URL in your web browser or Postman.

*Directions step 6 - What the instructions page will look like when you enter https://localhost:7221/MiniCh8 into Postman or a web browser*

Hi there! Let's reverse some numbers today!

Use the following URL: https://localhost:7221/minich8/reversenum/

Then you can add whatever numbers you want after the reversenum/ and I'll reverse it for you!

If you're lazy you can try my URL: https://localhost:7221/minich8/reversenum/123456789

Bored of numbers? Use this link to reverse some words!

https://localhost:7221/minich8/reverseword/

If you want an example you can use my name at https://localhost:7221/minich8/reverseword/Brandon



# Peer Review: Noah Bague
The program looks nice there was not any flaws/errors code works properly i aprrove of the code. the links from the error codes were a good addition.
